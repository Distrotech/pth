<p>GNU Pth - The GNU Portable Threads
  Version 2.0.7 (08-Jun-2006)</p>

<p>ABSTRACT</p>

<p>Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
  which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
  threads of execution (aka `multithreading') inside event-driven
  applications. All threads run in the same address space of the server
  application, but each thread has its own individual program-counter,
  run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.</p>

<p>The thread scheduling itself is done in a cooperative way, i.e., the
  threads are managed by a priority- and event-based non-preemptive
  scheduler. The intention is, that this way one can achieve better
  portability and run-time performance than with preemptive scheduling.
  The event facility allows threads to wait until various types of
  events occur, including pending I/O on filedescriptors, asynchronous
  signals, elapsed timers, pending I/O on message ports, thread and
  process termination, and even customized callback functions.</p>

<p>Additionally Pth provides an optional emulation API for POSIX.1c
  threads (`Pthreads') which can be used for backward compatibility to
  existing multithreaded applications.</p>

<p>Finally, Pth guarranties its fixed set of API functionality on
  all platforms, i.e., functions like pth_poll(3), pth_readv(3) or
  pth_writev(3) are always available, even if the particular underlaying
  platform does not actually support their functionality (through the
  system calls poll(2), readv(2), writev(2), etc).</p>

<p>Although Pth is very feature-rich, it is a rather small threading
  library. It consists only of approximately 7,000 line (or 300 KB) of
  ANSI C code which are auto-configured with approximately 400 lines (or
  60 KB) of Autoconf/m4 macros and which are documented by approximately
  3,000 lines (or 150 KB) of documentation. Additionally the sources
  are documented with approximately 3,600 additional lines of comments.
  As a result, the whole source tree is just about 1.5 MB in size and
  fits into a small tarball less than 350 KB in size. This allows Pth to
  fit very well even into the source tree of other applications without
  bloating it up very much.</p>

<p>Pth was successfully tested on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSDI,
  GNU/Linux, Solaris, HPUX, Tru64 (OSF/1), AIX, IRIX, UnixWare, SCO
  OpenServer, SINIX, ReliantUNIX, ISC, AmigaOS, Rhapsody (MacOS X), FTX,
  AUX and Win32/Cygwin. And it should should automatically adjust itself
  to remaining Unix platforms, too.</p>
