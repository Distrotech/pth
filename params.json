All threads run in the same address space of the server\r\n  application, but each thread has its own individual program-counter,\r\n  run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.\r\n\r\n  The thread scheduling itself is done in a cooperative way, i.e., the\r\n  threads are managed by a priority- and event-based non-preemptive\r\n  scheduler. The intention is, that this way one can achieve better\r\n  portability and run-time performance than with preemptive scheduling.\r\n  The event facility allows threads to wait until various types of\r\n  events occur, including pending I/O on filedescriptors, asynchronous\r\n  signals, elapsed timers, pending I/O on message ports, thread and\r\n  process termination, and even customized callback functions.\r\n\r\n  Additionally Pth provides an optional emulation API for POSIX.1c\r\n  threads (`Pthreads') which can be used for backward compatibility to\r\n  existing multithreaded applications.\r\n\r\n  Finally, Pth guarranties its fixed set of API functionality on\r\n  all platforms, i.e., functions like pth_poll(3), pth_readv(3) or\r\n  pth_writev(3) are always available, even if the particular underlaying\r\n  platform does not actually support their functionality (through the\r\n  system calls poll(2), readv(2), writev(2), etc).\r\n\r\n  Although Pth is very feature-rich, it is a rather small threading\r\n  library. It consists only of approximately 7,000 line (or 300 KB) of\r\n  ANSI C code which are auto-configured with approximately 400 lines (or\r\n  60 KB) of Autoconf/m4 macros and which are documented by approximately\r\n  3,000 lines (or 150 KB) of documentation. Additionally the sources\r\n  are documented with approximately 3,600 additional lines of comments.\r\n  As a result, the whole source tree is just about 1.5 MB in size and\r\n  fits into a small tarball less than 350 KB in size. This allows Pth to\r\n  fit very well even into the source tree of other applications without\r\n  bloating it up very much.\r\n\r\n  Pth was successfully tested on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSDI,\r\n  GNU/Linux, Solaris, HPUX, Tru64 (OSF/1), AIX, IRIX, UnixWare, SCO\r\n  OpenServer, SINIX, ReliantUNIX, ISC, AmigaOS, Rhapsody (MacOS X), FTX,\r\n  AUX and Win32/Cygwin. And it should should automatically adjust itself\r\n  to remaining Unix platforms, too.\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE\r\n\r\n  Copyright (c) 1999-2006 Ralf S.
